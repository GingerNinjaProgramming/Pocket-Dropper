### Project Outline

My project is a simple 2D infinite dropper game in the same vein as something like Downwell (Downwell on Steam, s.d.) or Jetpack joyride (Studios, s.d.) being in the up and down instead of the left and right. The main loop of the game will consist of player infinity falling facing obstacles along the way. This fits to the theme of pocket as in the theming of the game the player is a item being dropped into someones pocket.

## Research

### What sources or references have you identified as relevant to this task?

* What types of sources did you explore and why?
* Which types of sources did you avoid and why?
* How does the research relate to the user experience, technical approach, or creative aim?

### Sources

For each source, provide:

1. An **opening paragraph** describing the source's creator/publisher, reputation, and relevance.
2. A **bullet list** of what you analysed or learned from it.
3. A **closing paragraph** evaluating its usefulness or limitations.

You may include both **academic resources** and **industry examples** (e.g. documentation, games, developer talks). You are encouraged to include plenty of images, videos and diagrams.

#### Mastering C++ a Beginners Guide

When doing research for this project I first looked at material on C++, as this was my first major time using C++. One such book was  __Mastering C++ a Beginners Guide__ (Bin Uzayr, 2022). I did this to help improve my C++ knowledge as at the time this was a new language to me and though familiar with programming I wanted to be sure that I don't miss any syntax differences between C++ and another language like C#. I learned many things about C++ reading from this books including:

* Vectors
* Pointers 
* Data Types
* Header files
* C++ OOP techniques

This book was very useful in my early C++ journey allowing me to iron out the details and differences between C++ and any other programming languages giving me a good starting point to start coding in raylib. However, by its very nature, being a beginner guide it does not break down everything and a lot of other things still had to be learned from experience / prior knowledge so while being a good spring board for work many things still had to be learned from other means like in person lectures.

### Methodology

- Process of research, testing, how you want to approach proj
    - you will be looking at examples of _____ [something to do with proj]
    - you will doing guided testing and collecting data

### Game Sources 

- Inspiration 


## Academic Sources 

- An academic source of some description that guided you
- Google Scholar

### Documentation Sources

- Youtube tutorials
- Documentation like on unreal

## Implementation

### Process

### New Approaches

- First time doing yadada and how learning that went

### User Testing

- Talk about how users felt on first test
- Show data
- Talk about second test / benchmark
- Qualitive and Quantitive 
- Guided or non guided 

## Outcome

- Video of game demostration
- Trailer if applicable 
- Figma board
- Trello board
- Itch link

## Instructions to Install / Run

- Instructions to interact with source code

## Reflection 

### Research Effectiveness 

- Was the research effective

### Positive analysis

### Negative analysis

### Next time

- wht u learnt and now want to do more of
- what is guiding intrests 


## Declared Assets

Version Control: **Git** / **Github**

IDE - **Clion** 

Engine - **Raylib**

Throughout the creation of this project I used a combination of github copilot and chatgpt to help debug problems. This is along with using AI to help create the initial boiler plate for the [CMakeLists](CMakeLists.txt) which was used to debug the entire the project.

I used mainly self made assets for this project with the only thing not directly made by me being the background music called Pixel Peeker Polka (Pixel Peeker Polka - faster, 2020) which is covered under creative commons license  allowing for use,altering,etc as long as the creator is credited 

- External Libarys:
    - Raylib-Aseprite (Loach, 2025) was used to facilitate aseprite files to be used as sprites in the game
    - RayMath (raylib/src/raymath.h at master · raysan5/raylib, s.d.) was used for easy access to alot of game math functions and classes
    - RayGUI (Ray, 2025) was used to facilitate a basic pause menu
